# gene-palindromes-finder
A DNA palindrome is a sequence for which the header bases are the reverse complement of the tail bases. For example, ACCTAGGT and GGATCC.

Another type of DNA palindrome is called inverted repeat, where there is a 'spacer region' which are random nucleotides exists in the middle of the palindromic sequence. For example, AAG_CTT, GCCC_GGGC and TACGnnnnnnCGTAA.

This program aims to find all the palindromes including inverted repeats in a gene sequence. User can choose to enter raw sequence, FASTA file or Genbank file.
